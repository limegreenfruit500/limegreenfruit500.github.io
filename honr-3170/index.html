                <div>
                    For many people, your first semester of college is an overwhelming fresh start in life at the very beginning of your adult life. You may be away from the friend group you stuck with through high school, and you are now looking for a new social circle. Social media could be your friend when it comes to keeping in touch with the people away from you now, but more than ever it is crucial to play things safe in a new environment away from home. For some women, you may not have even moved in, and after that change within your bio or a post saying where you are enrolling, it isn't uncommon to have a handful of people you have no prior contact with starting to follow you. It could be fine, but it is not uncommon for women to receive unsolicited messages from upperclassmen, specifically from men. Reaching out to your roommates in the summer before you all arrive to discuss who could be bringing what for a suite, or in a traditional style dorm, figuring out how your belongings can coexist in the same space, or just befriending your roommates, is recommended by myself. However, I have yet to hear a good thing about an upperclassman following incoming freshman women on his Instagram. Your interactions starting over text make it much easier for a possible predator to play a character from behind the screen. If you are able to go and make friends with someone you know you can trust, branching out is a much safer scenario considering the things that come with young adults being left unsupervised after a tame three month stretch in the summer.

                    It might not happen the first try, but as long as you can make good decisions, and set boundaries with the new people in your lives, the other things can seemingly just fall into place. Those who flunk out of college aren't convicted by the jump in course material, but rather with how they deal with their newfound freedom. Be safe wherever you are!!!

                <summary>Tip Number One: Don’t be afraid to pick and choose your battles!</summary>
                <div>
                    Allow me to explain. We all know that higher education's price tag isn’t exactly getting much smaller, so you may feel inclined to “get every dollar” out of your education and write off registering for online or asynchronous classes. I am here to tell you, if you have an already packed schedule filled with running around campus from class to class like I did myself, you will lose more value out of your education from the exhaustion of running around from lecture to lecture as opposed to having a fully asynchronous class or just needing to join a zoom meeting from wherever you are. Naturally, there may be some classes you feel like you need to take in person to get that hands on experience, but for classes you feel you might not need to sit through with less essential information being taught or if you cannot consistently commute to a class consistently, it is much better to put your energy towards studying course material on your own time or joining an online lecture. Burnout is very real, and there will be days where you really feel unmotivated to get out of bed or run around for a day. Pace your days to keep burnout at bay!

                <summary>Tip Number Two: Be honest, are you really going to go to that 8:00am class?</summary>
                <div>
                    For some classes, you are just going to have to take what you get with their instruction times. I have been in that situation far too many times already. But a tip for all of those who need their sleep or have trouble waking up, avoid at all costs. Your workload throughout the semester will only increase more and more, and in my experience, with it, the quality of your sleep will decrease as well. It is of note to take some of this with a grain of salt, as I have been heralded as one of the world's heaviest sleepers, but with that being said, the hardest part of my day was frequently just waking up. Especially with those who live in dorms far away from their classes, or worse, those who are commuters.

                <summary>Tip Number Three: Make sure your eligible credits from high school are recognized by your institution!</summary>
                <div>
                    Most high school students end up taking an AP class before they graduate high school, and many colleges will take that credit and put it towards your degree. Some colleges will even take some of your high school credits that aren’t in the AP program and put them towards the completion of your degree as well. I am now in year 3 at UNC Charlotte, and miraculously having sent my AP credits sent twice before this, I have once again sent my AP scores for hopefully the final time. I do not believe that I have taken classes that would overlap with my eligible AP credits, but if I did, I would definitely be very mad having dedicated 2 or 3 credit hours all for naught. Your college may not accept your credits, but if they say they will, do everything in your power to verify that, and do NOT waste a couple credit hours on gen ed’s you could be using to get ahead with your major, or working towards the gen ed’s you don’t have any credit for.

            <div>
                Social media can be used to make connections with people, entertainment, or to just keep up to date with what's going on around the world. If you are going to a college with students living on campus, there is a very good chance that you have a public snapchat story to view at your own risk. Some of these posts are going to be completely uninteresting, some may be someone selling something, some may even be people posting about something they found that someone lost. But sometimes there is a post that catches the attention of everyone who sees it, and that usually isn’t a good thing for the person involved in it. This content isn’t even always something that was done for all surrounding people to see, and that is the scariest part of it all. You may have said something that you thought would fall on deaf ears or done something in what you thought was complete security and privacy, but in this day and age that is not the case. What you say and do can easily be pictured, screenshotted, and video’d, and unfortunately the only line of defense you have is your actions. Here at UNC Charlotte, there are accounts dedicated to almost anything you can think of, and some of them have thousands of followers who could very well be your classmates, and the same rule applies to many other colleges and universities. All in all, don’t become the hottest post on the Snapchat story or the Barstool page, but if you are too prideful to say you follow those pages for entertainment, take all of it as a learning opportunity of what NOT to do in college.

            <div>
                One of the best things you can do for yourself getting onto college campus is to get active in clubs and groups within your respective major or even within your interests. Your resume can only get you so much in the age of AI inflating job requirements to land an interview. In college now, you need to make connections with employers, alumni, and professors to secure your future in and out of college. A given necessity is heading to your local career fairs to scout out your potential future employers, but I also advise you to look into your college’s learning communities and honors programs! Not only will you be surrounded by like minded students, but there is also a chance you have some more immediate benefits to joining these experiences such as guaranteed housing and priority registration for classes, and there will be more exclusive opportunities to talk to alumni of the communities for networking opportunities! If those short term benefits don’t interest you right now, I will advise you to trust me and start working for the long term benefits as soon as possible!!! You can almost everyone your resume, but not everyone may give you the time of day if you can’t relate to them in one way or another.

            Before you were sent off to college, many of us got the same advice from our parents or guardians. They urge us to make good choices and also probably mention something about the danger of freedom and the role access to substances has on us, but your phone can affect you long term more than that of a bad hangover. It’s ironic to come from myself preaching the dangers of social media, and more specifically what I am about to say about short form content consumption as someone writing a short form blog post, but seriously, it can rewire your brain in more ways than you imagine. Some people need short form content to get that constant dopamine release that turns to addiction, but beyond the necessity for the dopamine, it is doing you no favors in the classroom either. Your attention span can easily be shot down by high volume consumption of short form content. You may not be able to cut it out of your life entirely, as there are even social connections that enable short form media to hold your attention, such as whenever your friend asks you, “hey, did you see that reel I sent you?” It could be a five second steal, but your friend may have sent you something they think might interest you, whether it’s a video genre or someone’s dedicated account, you are now in a rabbit hole! But I urge you, when you know you have a heavy academic load in the next coming week, put a can on short form content. Prepare your attention span, and block it out. My experience with productivity seems to be the most efficient when I am in what feels like a rhythm. Bouncing around from topic to topic is hard to accomplish for homework, and at the end of the year, chances are you have a test, presentation, or paper to write that requires absolute attention. Prepare yourself! It isn’t just booze anymore!

            <div>
                Treat AI as a smart assistant, not a replacement for learning. Use models to:
                - Generate small examples, skeletons, or alternative approaches when you're stuck.
                - Explain concepts, algorithms, and unfamiliar library APIs in plain language.
                - Suggest test cases, edge cases, or debugging strategies for tricky bugs.
                - Help refactor repetitive code, but always read and understand the changes.
                Always verify outputs: run the code, write tests, and review for correctness and security.

            <div>
                - Follow your instructor's policy: disclose and cite AI assistance where required.  
                - Never submit AI-generated work as your own for graded assignments. Use it for learning or drafts only.  
                - Never paste passwords, API keys, or private datasets into public models. Use local or trusted university tools for sensitive data.  
                - Keep a reproducible record: note model name/version, prompts, and which parts were AI-assisted.  
                - Validate for bias and hallucinations—AI can produce plausible but incorrect answers.  
                - Run linters, static analysis, and security checks on any AI-produced code before use.  
                - Use version control and code reviews; treat AI output like any third-party snippet you must vet.

                College is a time for growth, but it’s easy to feel pressure to fit in or impress others. Authenticity means showing up as yourself—honest in your work, true in your interactions, and genuine in your goals. Professors and peers value integrity: original ideas, honest effort, and respectful communication build trust and lasting connections. When you present your real self, you invite others to do the same, making campus a more supportive and meaningful place for everyone.

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, students who get 7–9 hours of sleep per night have <strong>higher GPAs</strong> than those who sleep less. Research from the University of St. Thomas found that students with healthy sleep habits were <strong>twice as likely to report academic success</strong> compared to those with irregular sleep schedules. Good sleep improves memory, focus, and even your mood—making it easier to handle stress and stay motivated.
